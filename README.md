jekyll.exe v2
=============

Original code is in https://github.com/altbdoor/jekyll-exe, and modified to run with GitHub actions.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/altbdoor/jekyll-exe-2/releases) page for downloads.

Note
----

[OCRA](https://github.com/larsch/ocra) only supports up to Ruby 2.1, and does not seem to be supported anymore.

As far as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is concerned, only v3.9.x still supports Ruby 2.1, and a lot of the dependencies have also moved on.

A lot of version pinning is done to make things work, but it also means the binaries are running on very outdated libraries.
